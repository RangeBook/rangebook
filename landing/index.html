  <h2>The New Frontier</h2>
   <p>
    Once, men set out across the frontier and mapped the wilderness. Today we face a different terrain, just as challenging: distraction, indecision, mental clutter.  
    <strong>Rangebook is for the modern explorer.</strong> A journal built for the inner frontier — a place to think clearly, move with purpose, and live on principle.

  <h2>This Isn’t for Everyone</h2>
  <p>
    This isn’t mindfulness. It’s not self-care. It’s not a diary.
    <br><br>
    Rangebook is a tool. One prompt a day. No fluff. No dopamine drip. No applause.
    <br><br>
    Just you, your thoughts, and the truth.

  <h2>Why I Built This</h2>
  <p>Most journaling apps felt like therapy or trend-chasing. Rangebook is different: it’s a mental discipline tool — built for focus, not validation.</p>
</section>

<section class="founder-statement">
  <p>
    I didn’t need another habit tracker. I needed a space where I could sharpen my thinking, build discipline, and get clear — without noise, without excuses.
